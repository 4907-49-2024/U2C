% Ref: https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/research-writing/journal-article-writing/writing-an-abstract

% Whereas the purpose of an introduction is to broadly introduce your topic and your key message, the purpose of an abstract is to give an overview of your entire project, in particular its findings and contribution to the field. An abstract should be a standalone summary of your paper, which readers can use to decide whether it's relevant to them before they dive in to read the paper.

% Usually an abstract includes the following.
%     A brief introduction to the topic that you're investigating.
%     Explanation of why the topic is important in your field/s.
%     Statement about what the gap is in the research.
%     Your research question/s / aim/s.
%     An indication of your research methods and approach.
%     Your key message.
%     A summary of your key findings.
%     An explanation of why your findings and key message contribute to the field/s.

% It should answer these questions:
% What is your paper about?
% Why is it important?
% How did you do it?
% What did you find?
% Why are your findings important?

% Other version have this simplified structure:
% Background, Methodology, Results, Conclusion
