\subsection{Problem Background}\label{subsec:problem-background}
Modern system requirements are becoming increasingly complex over time.
To fulfill these requirements, engineers typically go through a modelling phase.
Models are artifacts from the modelling phase which represent different views of the system, in order to understand aspects of the system better.
A common modelling technique is to produce graphical models, in languages such as UML (Unified Modelling Language) to quickly communicate information through visual system interactions.
These visual models are great to communicate understanding across levels of system details between humans,
but they tend to be written with informal modelling languages due to their simplicity.
This means the semantic meaning of the model is nondeterministic, and computers cannot interpret most graphical models.
In contrast, there are formal modelling languages like C2KA (Communicating Concurrent Kleene Algebra) which have a defined semantics.
This allows computers to perform rigorous automated model checking on formal models of the system.
This means critical system properties like safety, and liveness can be proven at the model level before any system implementation starts.

System descriptions can vary in quality, especially across different stages of design.
They can range from informal and incomplete natural language descriptions,
to well-defined formal requirements.
Engineers need to make reasonable decisions on how to model systems from these descriptions.
This often means going for informal visual models which are easy to produce, and communicate with.
Even with their known model checking benefits, formal models are often dismissed.
They require more time to make, but also specialized skills to produce and understand them.
This means formal models cannot easily replace informal models, they typically supplement them.

\subsection{Problem Motivation}\label{subsec:problem-motivation}
We would like to take advantages of the benefits of formal modelling methodologies without having to face the barriers they typically impose.
We believed we could take advantage of the informal models that are typically created to derive formal models with minimal additional cost.
We were specifically interested in the C2KA formalism for a few reasons.
The language is useful for model checking system properties relating to interactions between components, which is an important concern in complex systems with many components.
The language is new, and has low tool support meaning our tool could contribute significantly to its growth.
Experienced C2KA modellers believed this model transformation was possible in this formalism.
This gave us confidence that our project would be feasible, and useful.
