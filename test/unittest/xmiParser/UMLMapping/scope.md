UMLMappings are considered out of scope of testing because they're basically constants. 
Tests verifying a constant remains the same is not a useful test, and it may be detrimental. 

There's not much to test in code as far as I can tell, 
from my current understanding cross-checks need to be done through manual verification on initial setup of these classes.
