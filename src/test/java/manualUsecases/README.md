# Purpose
I'm not sure if we'll keep this, but the idea is we can represent use cases as manualUsecases. 
Partial outputs of the program that can be tested. 

Most of our code will require setup by the nature of our architechture, I think testing will evolve to be done this way exclusively.

For now, I'm adding some manual tests so we can get certain "views" without modifying main every time.
